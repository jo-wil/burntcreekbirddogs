      <p class="lead">Burnt Creek Bird Dogs is a small, family run business that focuses on personalized dog training to fit each clientâ€™s needs. We specialize in working breed obedience and gun dog training. Located in beautiful northern Reno, our training is based from our home as well as the hundreds of open public Nevada lands. We offer dog drop off group and private sessions, private sessions with you, and board & train programs. Because we are a small kennel we only take a certain amount of dogs in at a time for both board and train and for lessons. This means we spend more time 1 on 1 time with each dog to make sure they are getting the most out of the time they spend with us.</p>
      <p class="lead">All training options include one free 1 hour consultation with you and your pup where we evaluate your dog and where they are at to create a unique training program for each dogs needs.</p>
